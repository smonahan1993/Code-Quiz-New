# Code-Quiz

This project was for Homework 4 of GA Tech's Coding Bootcamp. The Assignment calls for us to create a code quiz that decrements the timer when an incorrect answer is given. 
The final score is the amount of time you have left at the end of the quiz. This should then show high scores based on user initials and scores for those who have taken the quiz.

Here is a screen shot of the app:
